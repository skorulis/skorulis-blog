Went through and finally got my website and blog off [arvixe](http://www.arvixe.com/). I've been meaning to do this for a long time as I've been paying for hosting that I really haven't been making great use of but since it was working without any intervention I never got around to it. Now all my hosting is done by github and I just have to pay for the DNS for my domains. This also makes it much easier to make changes to my website as I just have to push the commit and it's done.

Now I just have to wait for the current domain to stop showing the correct page (5-8 days) and then make the DNS changes to point to github and I can be done with arvixe forever. And not a moment too soon after I forgot my password and they emailed it to me in plaintext. That's a massive security hole to have when it comes to my hosting.
